# Design Idea Engine - Detailed Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Analyze blueprint and create detailed implementation plan

### 1.1 Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the Design Idea Engine, a system designed to automate the creation and publishing of design ideas to various online marketplaces. The plan is structured to ensure a surgical, lean, and cost-effective approach, prioritizing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) while laying a solid foundation for future scalability and feature expansion. The ultimate goal is to achieve an Apple-level UX/UI, ensuring a fluid and intuitive user experience.

### 1.2 Guiding Principles

*   **Modularity and Microservices:** Adhere to a microservices architecture with loose coupling via an event bus (Kafka/Pub-Sub) to ensure scalability, resilience, and independent deployability of components.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Prioritize open-source solutions and cloud-native services with consumption-based pricing models. Leverage spot instances for GPU-intensive tasks and implement intelligent storage lifecycle policies.
*   **Scalability:** Design for horizontal scalability across all layers, from signal ingestion to AI model inference and marketplace publishing.
*   **User Experience (UX/UI):** Focus on delivering an intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing interface, aiming for an 


Apple-level experience. This includes thoughtful design of the Admin Dashboard and one-click publishing flows.
*   **Automation and Efficiency:** Maximize automation throughout the design idea lifecycle, from signal ingestion and scoring to mock-up generation and marketplace publishing. Minimize manual intervention wherever possible.
*   **Data-Driven Iteration:** Implement robust feedback loops and analytics to continuously optimize the scoring engine, AI models, and overall system performance based on real-world marketplace data.
*   **Security and Compliance:** Integrate security best practices from the outset, including data privacy, brand safety (trademark checks, NSFW filtering), and robust testing methodologies.

### 1.4 Core Data Model (Simplified)

The blueprint provides a simplified ER diagram for the core data model. This will be translated into database schemas during implementation.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    SIGNAL {
      uuid id PK
      text content
      source ENUM
      captured_at TIMESTAMP
      metadata JSONB
      hash CHAR(32) UNIQUE
    }
    IDEA ||--|| SIGNAL : derived_from
    IDEA {
      uuid id PK
      title TEXT
      embedding VECTOR(768)
      score FLOAT
      status ENUM(queued, mocked, live, archived)
      created_at TIMESTAMP
      updated_at TIMESTAMP
    }
    MOCKUP ||--|| IDEA : for
    MOCKUP {
      uuid id PK
      s3_uri TEXT
      variant ENUM(front, back, colorway)
      ctr FLOAT
    }
```

### 1.5 Key Takeaways from Blueprint

*   **Event-driven microservices** and a robust vector store are crucial for speed and flexibility.
*   **Layered scoring** allows for lean iteration and feedback-driven improvements.
*   **GPU-intensive steps** are isolated behind queues to maintain cost-effectiveness and speed for other services.
*   The roadmap prioritizes early value delivery (one source, one marketplace) while building a solid foundation for scale.

This detailed plan will guide the development process, ensuring all aspects of the Design Idea Engine are addressed systematically and efficiently. The next step will be to finalize the technology stack and design the detailed architecture.
