# Design Idea Engine Blueprint

This consolidated blueprint summarizes the project's goals, architecture, and deployment approach. It merges content from the previous design documents.

## Objectives and Success Metrics

| Goal | KPI | Target |
| ---- | --- | ----- |
| Generate high-potential design ideas | Ideas scored in top-quartile freshness & engagement | ≥ 200/day |
| Automate mock-up creation | Ideas with at least one AI mock-up | 95% |
| Validate via feedback loop | Statistically significant positive signal (CTR, Saves, Add-to-Cart) | 25% |
| Time-to-publish | Ingest → live mock-up on marketplace | ≤ 2 h |

## High-Level Architecture

The system uses event-driven microservices communicating through a message bus. Core services include:

- **Signal Ingestion** – collects trending data from social networks and events.
- **Scoring Engine** – ranks ideas using freshness, engagement, novelty, community fit and seasonality.
- **AI Mock-up Generation** – produces design variations with Stable Diffusion XL and post-processing.
- **Marketplace Publisher** – automates listing creation and one-click publishing.
- **Feedback Loop** – gathers marketplace metrics and performs A/B tests for continuous optimization.
- **Orchestrator & CI/CD** – manages workflows, deploys with blue‑green strategies, and monitors health.

### Data Stores

PostgreSQL with pgvector stores metadata and embeddings. S3 holds mock-up assets. Redis caches hot topics and supports rate limiting. Kafka (or another event bus) connects the services.

## Implementation Roadmap (Summary)

1. **Analysis & Planning** – finalize technology stack and architecture diagrams.
2. **Core Services** – implement Signal Ingestion, Data Storage and Scoring Engine with API endpoints.
3. **AI Integration** – add Prompt Builder, mock-up generation and listing draft creation.
4. **Frontend Dashboard** – build a responsive Next.js admin dashboard.
5. **Marketplace Integration** – enable one-click publish and ingest performance data.
6. **Monitoring & Optimization** – integrate observability, automate scaling and ensure brand safety.
7. **Testing & Deployment** – run comprehensive tests, then deploy via Docker/Kubernetes.

## Deployment Overview

Deployment uses Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes or Docker Compose. Production setups include SSL termination, centralized logging, and auto‑scaling on cloud providers (AWS, GCP or Azure). A blue‑green strategy enables zero‑downtime updates.

## Cost and Performance Considerations

- Use spot instances for GPU-intensive tasks and batch embeddings to maximize VRAM.
- Archive mock-ups over 12 months in colder storage.
- Monitor quotas and stagger API calls to reduce third-party costs.

## Quality, Governance and Compliance

- Trademark checks with USPTO/EUIPO APIs before publishing.
- NSFW filtering using CLIP-based models.
- Data privacy via public-only content storage and PII purging.
- Automated tests and contract tests for external APIs using VCR.py cassettes.

## Key Takeaways

Event-driven microservices with a robust vector store provide scalability and flexibility. Layered scoring enables iterative improvements while GPU-intensive tasks remain isolated behind queues for cost effectiveness. The roadmap prioritizes shipping value early while building a foundation for future scale.
