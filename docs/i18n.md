# Internationalization Workflow

This project uses `i18next` with `react-i18next` for client side translations in the admin dashboard. All text visible to users should be referenced through the `t()` helper so strings can be translated.

## Adding or updating translations

1. Edit the locale files under `frontend/admin-dashboard/src/locales`. Each language has its own folder with a `common.json` file.
2. After modifying translation files, commit the changes.
3. Run `npm run lint` in `frontend/admin-dashboard` to ensure ESLint passes.
4. Tests can be run with `npm test` and `pytest` from the repository root.

## Creating new strings

Wrap any new user-facing text with the `t()` hook from `react-i18next` and add the key/value pair to the locale files.

This keeps translations in one place and makes it easy to add more languages in the future.
