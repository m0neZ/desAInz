Pre-built model weights can be placed here to avoid fetching them from external repositories each time.
For example download `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0` using the provided
`scripts/download_resources.py` script. Models are loaded from this directory when
`MODEL_CACHE_DIR` is set to `prebuilt/models` (default).
